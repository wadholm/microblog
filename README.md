Course material for a devops course, aimed at a Swedish course in computer science on University level new to devops. The students are to further develop this application and integreate it with new tools.

Released as part of a University course: https://dbwebb.se/kurser/devops

The application used in this course is based on [The flask mega tutorial](https://blog.miguelgrinberg.com/post/the-flask-mega-tutorial-part-i-hello-world).




Dev environment
------------------

Here is how you setup the development environment and start the application.



### Packages

Create a virtual environment and install packages:
```
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
make install-dev
```

If you are on Windows and Cygwin you will probably have troubles installing the pip package `cryptography`. Common errors are missing `python.h`, `gcc`, `cffi` and `openssl`. 


### Database

Setup SQLite database if `migrations` folder already exist:
```
flask db upgrade
```

If you have upgraded the code for any SQLAlchemy models:
```
flask db migrate -m '<message>'
flask db upgrade
```

You probably won't need to do this. But if you need to recreate `app.db` and migrations folder:
```
flask db init
flask db migrate -m '<message>'
flask db upgrade
```

If you have the wrong migrations version in the database when you want to upgrade it you can change it with:
```
flask db stamp head
flask db upgrade
```



### Test application

There are several make commands for testing the application. Use `make help` to see which. To run all tests and validation use:
```
make test
```



### Run application

Start byt setting the FLASK_APP and FLASK_ENV env vars:
```
export FLASK_APP=microblog.py
export FLASK_ENV=development
```
Change to use the DevConfig in `microblog.py`, uncomment `# from app.config import DevConfig` and `# app = create_app(DevConfig)` (comment `app = create_app()`).

Start the app with the following command and go to `localhost:5000` in your browser.
```
flask run
```



Production environment
------------------

Follow the scripts in `scripts/` or [Driftsätta en flask app](https://dbwebb.se/kunskap/driftsatta-en-flask-app).
